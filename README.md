Title: **_2D Hybrid Magnetic Field Model Performance Optimization for Linear Induction Motors_**

This repository includes most of the relevant Python code for my Ma.Sc. motor simulation and optimization software.
Due to intellectual property, not all the code can be released.
An attached [.PPTX](https://github.com/MichaelThamm/MaSc-LinearInductionMotorGeneticOptimization/blob/main/ProjectExplanation_GitHub.pptx) file is provided in this repo that highlights the top-down foundation of the coding project.
Information on the code containing intellectual property can only be found in this .PPTX file
