# MaSc-LinearInductionMotorGeneticOptimization
2D Hybrid Magnetic Field Model Performance Optimization for Linear Induction Motors

This repository includes most of the relevant Python code for my MaSc motor simulation and optimization software.
Due to intellectual property, not all the code can be released.
An attached [.PPTX]() file is provided in this repo that highlights the top-down foundation of the coding project.
Information on the code containing intellectual property can only be found in this .PPTX file
